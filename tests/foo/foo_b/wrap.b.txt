The
boxed
moved.
That
was
a
problem.
Peter
had
packed
the
box
three
hours
before
and
there
was
nothing
inside
that
should
make
it
move.
The
question
now
was
whether
or
not
Peter
was
going
to
open
it
up
and
look
inside
to
see
why
it
had
moved.
The
answer
to
that
question
was
obvious.
Peter
dropped
the
package
into
the
mailbox
so
he
would
never
have
to
see
it
again.
