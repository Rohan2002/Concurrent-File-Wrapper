“Ingredients for life,”
said the backside of the
truck. They mean food, but
really food is only 1
ingredient of life. Life has
so many more ingredients such
as pain, happiness, laughter,
joy, tears, and smiles. Life
also has hard work, easy play,
sleepless nights, and
sunbathing by the ocean. Love,
hatred, envy, self-assurance,
and fear could be just down
aisle 3 ready to be bought
when needed. How I wish I
could pull ingredients like
these off shelves in a store.
