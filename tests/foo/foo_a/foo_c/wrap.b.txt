If you can imagine a furry
humanoid seven feet tall, with
the face of an intelligent
gorilla and the braincase of a
man, you'll have a rough idea
of what they looked like --
except for their teeth. The
canines would have fitted
better in the face of a tiger,
and showed at the corners of
their wide, thin-lipped
mouths, giving them an
expression of ferocity.
